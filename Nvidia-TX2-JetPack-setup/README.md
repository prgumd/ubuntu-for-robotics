# TX2 Ubuntu 16.04-L4T Setup with Connect-Tech-Carrier-Board

### A freshly installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS recommended on the host computer!
#### If there is any error during the setup, please follow these references: [Ref1](https://github.com/chahatdeep/ubuntu-for-robotics/blob/master/Nvidia-TX2-JetPack-setup/Flashing-and-Setup-Guide-for-a-Connect-Tech-Carrier-Board.md) | [Ref2](https://github.com/chahatdeep/ubuntu-for-robotics/blob/master/Nvidia-TX2-JetPack-setup/default.md)

### Note: The TX2 board setup is different for Connect Tech board as few of the drivers like USB doesn't work with the standard TX2 Ubuntu Setup

***

- Download the latest version of Nvidia JetPack (Jetsonâ„¢ SDK) [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack)

```
bash ./JetPack-L4T-XX-linux-x64.run # Don't use sudo
```

- Select `TX2`

- Enter admin password

- Select the `L4T OS` and any other packages you want (which are generally needed for Robotics application)

- After the download and installation are complete, close JetPack

*Do NOT finish flashing the target Jetson*

<!-- - Kill Jetson Installer once you see this: -->

## Connect Tech Support Package Setup:
- Go this this [link](http://connecttech.com/product/orbitty-carrier-for-nvidia-jetson-tx2-tx1/) and download the `L4T` support package from Connect Tech
- Copy the `CTI-L4T-V###.tgz` package into `<JetPack_install_dir>/64_TX2/Linux_for_Tegra_tx2/`

- Extract the BSP:
```
tar -xzf CTI-L4T-V###.tgz
```
*(replace ### with your file name)*

- Enter the `CTI-L4T` directory:
```
cd ./CTI-L4T
Run the install script as root
sudo ./install.sh
```

- Boot the Jetson into recovery mode by holding down the Force Recovery button on the Orbitty board and then pressing *power button*

- You can check the status by typing `lsusb` in terminal and checking for an Nvidia device

- Open a terminal from the `<JetPack_install_dir>/64_TX2/Linux_for_Tegra_tx2/` or simply do `cd ..` :

```
sudo ./flash.sh orbitty mmcblk0p1 # It should be mmcblk0p1 everytime unless you have multiple Linux board connected to your host machine.
```
*(Replace "orbitty" with whichever Connect Tech carrier board you have)*

- Wait for the process to finish and reboot.

- Expect Outputs like [this](https://github.com/chahatdeep/ubuntu-for-robotics/blob/master/Nvidia-TX2-JetPack-setup/Terminal-Output.md)

- Ubuntu will be installed on the `TX2` and it'll reboot with Unity interface on `Ubuntu-16.04-L4T`

**Mouse and Keyboard should work now!!!**

### Installing CUDA and Other Dependencies

- On TX2, do 
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

- Connect an HDMI display and a keyboard and mouse to the Orbitty carrier board.
- Boot unto Ubuntu using the following credentials:
```
Username: nvidia
Password: nvidia
```
- Connect the Jetson to your network via Ethernet (recommended) or wifi
- On the host computer, navigate to the JetPack install directory and launch JetPack
```sh
bash ./JetPack-L4T-XX-linux-x64.run
```
*(Replace the XX with the your version such as 3.1)*

- Enter your admin password

- In the Component Manager window, make sure "Host-Ubuntu" is set to "no action"

- Change "Flash OS Image to Target" to "no action"

- Only "Install on Target" should be selected 

<!-- --[Image here]-- -->

- Do `ifconfig` and check Device IP of TX2 machine! It should be the `inet addr` under `eth0` if you are connected to Ethernet or under `wlan0` if you are connected to Wireless LAN. (For example: `192.168.0.28`)
- Enter username and password as `nvidia` (default).
- Leave the Jetson at this point, do NOT reboot to recovery


- If you get error like this:
```
Return Code: 1
Error: Cannot connect to device with given information. Please check your input and try again.

Detailed info: 
/bin/bash: sshpass: command not found
```
You need to install `sshpass`, do `sudo apt install sshpass` on the host machine.

- Now, click on `Next` and let it install.
*Note: You might need to enter the password in the newly opened terminal.*

Notes: 

- Check CUDA version using `nvcc --version`. It should be `Cuda compilation tools, release 8.0, v8.0.72`
- Check opencv version using `python -c 'import cv2; print(cv2.__version__)'`
